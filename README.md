# Docru

**Docru** *(pronounced “do-crew”)*

A collaborative **Kanban workspace** for teams: multi-board drag-and-drop, List and Gantt views, real-time collaboration, optional sprint timeboxing with burndown, and an optional **AI Agent** that can assist on tasks, work linked Git repos, or (for admins) run board automations. Built with React/TypeScript and Node.js/Express.

Docru is **not** a full enterprise agile ALM (no required Epic/Story types, ceremony tooling, or hard methodology lock-in). Soft WIP limits, card aging, blocked flags, and column policy notes help teams keep flow healthy without ceremony overhead.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-board Kanban system** with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Soft WIP limits** on columns (warn when at/over limit; moves still allowed)
- **Card aging** (days in column) and optional **blocked** flag
- **Column policy notes** for short entry/exit guidance
- **Multiple view modes**: Kanban (visual board), List (table format), and Gantt (timeline) views
- **Real-time collaboration** - see changes instantly as team members work
- **User authentication** with local accounts and Google OAuth support
- **Role-based access control** (Admin/User permissions)
- **Theme support** - Light and dark mode

### AI Agent (optional)
- **Assign tasks to an Agent** when an admin enables AI for the instance
- **Assist** — Agent comments on the task using a configured LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama, or custom OpenAI-compatible)
- **Code** — Agent works a linked Git repository via the push runner (users add Profile → Dev credentials: API token and/or SSH key)
- **Automation** (admins) — board automation with dry-run review, Apply, and Undo
- **Live activity** on the card (queued / running / waiting) with pause, stop, and resume
- Configure in **Admin → AI Settings** (enable AI, provider, model, runner URL/token). Details: [Documentation.md — AI Agent](/Documentation.md#ai-agent) and [`docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md`](/docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md)

## Getting Started

**Default Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@kanban.local`
- Password: `generated` at initialization - look for it in the backend console log (or on the login page when demo mode is enabled)

1. Log in with the default admin account
2. Go to the admin panel and setup:
   1. The site name and URL in Site Settings
   2. In the App Settings, choose the default language (FR/EN)
   3. Review the Project Settings
   4. Add sprints in the Sprint Settings
   5. Review Reports Settings
3. Create team members in the Users Tab
4. Go to Kanban View and set up your boards and columns
5. Start creating and managing tasks
6. Configure Google OAuth (optional) in Admin > SSO settings
7. Configure AI Agent (optional) in Admin > AI Settings — for coding jobs, users then add Profile → Dev credentials

## Requirements

- Node.js v20.18+

## Installation

### Docker

**Step 1: Clone and setup**
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/drenlia/easy-kanban.git
cd easy-kanban
cp docker-compose-example.yml docker-compose.yml
```

**Step 2: Configure and run**
1. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and update the following environment variables:
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Set a strong secret key for authentication
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Set your domain(s), e.g., `yourdomain.com`
   - `DEMO_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to try the demo with generated data, `false` for production
   - Optional AI runner (for Agent **Code** jobs): `AI_RUNNER_URL`, `AI_CALLBACK_BASE_URL`, `RUNNER_TOKEN` (see compose example / `docker-compose-pro.yml`)

2. Start the application:
```bash
npm run docker:dev
```

**Access the application:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3010
- Backend API: http://localhost:3222

*For more Docker information, see [DOCKER.md](/DOCKER.md)*

## Database Backup & Restore

**Breaking change:** Docru is **PostgreSQL-only**. SQLite (`kanban.db`) is no longer supported. All Docker editions (free, demo, basic, pro) run Postgres + Redis. Existing SQLite data must be migrated out-of-band or you must start with a fresh Postgres volume.

### Automated Backup Script

```bash
# Create a timestamped pg_dump (gzipped) under ./backups
./scripts/backup-postgres.sh

# Restore latest (or pass a specific .sql.gz)
./scripts/restore-postgres.sh
./scripts/restore-postgres.sh ./backups/kanban-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz
```

**Features:**
- Timestamped dumps (`kanban-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz`)
- Keeps the last 10 dumps
- Latest symlink (`kanban-latest.sql.gz`)

### Manual Backup

```bash
docker exec easy-kanban-postgres pg_dump -U kanban_user -d kanban --clean --if-exists \
  | gzip > ./backups/kanban-manual.sql.gz
```

### Restore Database

```bash
gunzip -c ./backups/kanban-latest.sql.gz \
  | docker exec -i easy-kanban-postgres psql -U kanban_user -d kanban
```

**Important:** Prefer restoring while the app is stopped or briefly unavailable to avoid concurrent writes during restore.

## Security

The application includes JWT-based authentication and role-based access control. For production deployments:

- Change the default admin password immediately
- Set a strong `JWT_SECRET` in production
- Keep `DEMO_ENABLED=false` (demo compose is the exception)
- Do not set `ALLOW_TEST_ENDPOINTS` on real production hosts
- Configure HTTPS/TLS at the reverse proxy
- Attachments/avatars use an HttpOnly media cookie (not the session JWT in `?token=`)
- Review **Admin → Troubleshooting → CSP reports** before enforcing Content-Security-Policy
- Consider additional network security measures
